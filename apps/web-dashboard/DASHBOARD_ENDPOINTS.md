# Dashboard Endpoints Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the backend endpoints implemented to support the web dashboard with real data, replacing the previous mock data implementation.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. Dashboard Metrics (`GET /api/admin/dashboard/metrics`)

**Purpose**: Provides key performance indicators for the dashboard overview.

**Response**:

```typescript
{
  totalActiveEvents: number; // Events that haven't ended yet and are verified
  usersThisMonth: number; // New user registrations this month
  eventsScannedThisWeek: number; // QR code scans in the last 7 days
}
```

**Implementation Details**:

- Uses TypeORM query builder for efficient database queries
- Calculates time-based metrics (current month, last week)
- Filters for verified events only
- Counts from `UserEventDiscovery` table for scan metrics

### 2. Recent Activity Feed (`GET /api/admin/dashboard/activity`)

**Purpose**: Shows real-time activity happening on the platform.

**Response**:

```typescript
Array<{
  id: string;
  type:
    | "event_scanned"
    | "user_registered"
    | "event_created"
    | "category_added";
  title: string;
  description: string;
  timestamp: string;
  user?: {
    name: string;
    avatar?: string;
  };
  metadata?: Record<string, string | number | boolean>;
}>;
```

**Implementation Details**:

- Aggregates data from multiple sources (scans, registrations, events, categories)
- Limited to last 24 hours of activity
- Sorts by timestamp (most recent first)
- Includes user information where available
- Returns maximum 20 activities

### 3. Popular Categories (`GET /api/admin/dashboard/categories`)

**Purpose**: Shows which event categories are most popular.

**Response**:

```typescript
Array<{
  name: string;
  count: number;
  percentage: number;
  emoji: string;
}>;
```

**Implementation Details**:

- Uses SQL aggregation to count events per category
- Calculates percentage of total events
- Orders by event count (descending)
- Uses category `icon` field as emoji
- Limited to top 10 categories

### 4. Busiest Times (`GET /api/admin/dashboard/busiest-times`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes when events are most commonly scheduled.

**Response**:

```typescript
Array<{
  day: string;
  time: string;
  count: number;
}>;
```

**Implementation Details**:

- Analyzes events from last 30 days
- Uses PostgreSQL `EXTRACT` functions for day/hour analysis
- Groups by day of week and hour
- Formats time ranges (e.g., "2:00 PM - 4:00 PM")
- Orders by event count (descending)

### 5. Upcoming Events (`GET /api/admin/dashboard/upcoming-events`)

**Purpose**: Shows events scheduled in the near future.

**Response**:

```typescript
Array<{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  location: string;
  category: {
    name: string;
    emoji: string;
  };
  attendees: number;
  maxAttendees?: number;
}>;
```

**Implementation Details**:

- Shows events in next 30 days
- Only includes verified events
- Counts RSVPs with "GOING" status as attendees
- Orders by event date (ascending)
- Limited to 10 events

## Authentication & Security

All dashboard endpoints are protected by:

- **Authentication Middleware**: Requires valid JWT token
- **Admin Middleware**: Requires admin role
- **Rate Limiting**: 30 requests per minute per IP
- **IP Tracking**: Logs and tracks request origins

## Error Handling

Each endpoint includes comprehensive error handling:

- Database connection errors
- Query execution errors
- Invalid data errors
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provides detailed error messages for debugging

## Frontend Integration

The web dashboard has been updated to:

- Use real API calls instead of mock data
- Handle API failures gracefully with fallback data
- Maintain proper TypeScript typing
- Provide loading states and error handling

## Future Development Opportunities

### 1. Enhanced Analytics

- **User Engagement Metrics**: Time spent on platform, feature usage
- **Event Performance**: Success rates, cancellation rates
- **Geographic Analytics**: Popular locations, regional trends
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Event trends by season/month

### 2. Real-time Updates

- **WebSocket Integration**: Live dashboard updates
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time activity feed
- **Push Notifications**: Important metric alerts

### 3. Advanced Filtering

- **Date Range Selection**: Custom time periods for metrics
- **Category Filtering**: Filter analytics by event categories
- **User Segmentation**: Analytics by user types/roles

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Database Indexing**: Optimize queries for large datasets
- **Pagination**: Handle large result sets efficiently

### 5. Additional Metrics

- **Revenue Analytics**: If monetization features are added
- **Social Metrics**: Event sharing, friend connections
- **Content Analytics**: Popular event descriptions, images

### 6. Export & Reporting

- **Data Export**: CSV/PDF reports
- **Scheduled Reports**: Automated email reports
- **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable metrics

## Database Considerations

### Current Queries

- Most queries use efficient TypeORM query builders
- Proper use of indexes on date fields
- Aggregation queries for performance

### Optimization Opportunities

- Add composite indexes for common query patterns
- Consider materialized views for complex aggregations
- Implement query result caching for expensive operations

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Recommended Monitoring

- **Endpoint Response Times**: Track performance degradation
- **Error Rates**: Monitor for increased failures
- **Database Query Performance**: Slow query detection
- **Cache Hit Rates**: Redis performance monitoring

### Alerting Setup

- **High Error Rates**: Alert on increased failure rates
- **Slow Response Times**: Alert on performance issues
- **Database Issues**: Alert on connection problems
- **Cache Failures**: Alert on Redis issues

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test each endpoint with various data scenarios
- Mock database responses for consistent testing
- Test error handling and edge cases

### Integration Tests

- Test full request/response cycles
- Test authentication and authorization
- Test rate limiting and security measures

### Performance Tests

- Load test endpoints with realistic data volumes
- Test database query performance under load
- Monitor memory usage and response times

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables

- Ensure proper database connection strings
- Configure Redis connection details
- Set appropriate rate limiting values

### Database Migrations

- Ensure all required tables and indexes exist
- Test migrations on staging environment
- Plan for zero-downtime deployments

### Monitoring Setup

- Configure application performance monitoring
- Set up database monitoring
- Implement logging for debugging

## Conclusion

The dashboard endpoints provide a solid foundation for real-time analytics and monitoring. The implementation follows best practices for security, performance, and maintainability. Future enhancements can build upon this foundation to provide even more comprehensive insights into platform usage and performance.
