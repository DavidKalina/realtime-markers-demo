# Testing Strategy for WebSocket App

## ðŸŽ¯ Getting Started with Unit Testing

### What We're Testing

1. **Utility Functions** - Simple, pure functions (easiest to start with)
2. **Message Validation** - Input validation logic
3. **Business Logic** - Core application logic
4. **Integration Tests** - How components work together

### Testing Principles

- **Start Simple**: Begin with pure functions that have no side effects
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what the function does, not how it does it
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure your tests clearly
- **One Assertion Per Test**: Keep tests focused and readable

### File Structure

```
__tests__/
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.test.ts          # Simple utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ message-validation.test.ts  # Message format validation
â”œâ”€â”€ session-manager.test.ts     # Session management logic
â””â”€â”€ integration.test.ts         # Component integration tests
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
bun test --watch

# Run specific test file
bun test utils.test.ts
```

### Next Steps

1. âœ… Start with utility functions (DONE)
2. ðŸ”„ Add message validation tests
3. ðŸ”„ Test SessionManager class
4. ðŸ”„ Add integration tests
5. ðŸ”„ Add mock tests for external dependencies (Redis, WebSocket)

### Tips

- Don't try to test everything at once
- Focus on the most critical business logic first
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Keep tests independent - each test should be able to run in isolation
